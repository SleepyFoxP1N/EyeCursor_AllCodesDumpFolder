After 14 days of reattempting to compile the HelloWorld.cc of mediapipe now recording the attempts

// WED MAR 1 2023

Attempt 1.1:
- [ ] Step 1: Follow the instructions except the installing for python, opencv, and bazel. 
- [ ] Step 1.5: Imported bazel project through android studio
- [ ] Step 2: User sdk and ndk of android studio
- [ ] Step 3: Error regarding fetching, use “bazel clean --expunge”
- [ ] Compiled successfully but is not printing. 1 warning only (warning: 'sprintf' is deprecated)
- [ ] Resources: python@3.10 and @3.7 are installed. Used pip3 install opencv-python which is version 4.7.0 . Bazel version is 5.4.0 but bazelisk is installed. Mediapipe WORKSPACE has the same syntax when “bash setup_android_sdk_and_ndk.sh” is used but the pathing is directed to android studio jdk and ndk.

// THU MAR 2 2023

Attempt 1.2: CHANGING OPENCV 
- [ ] Step 1: Reworking with attempt 1. 
- [ ] Step 2: changing “pip3 uninstall opencv-python” to opencv@3.
- [ ] Step 3: Output is same with attempt 1

Attempt 1.3:  CHANGING MEDIAPIE (I used android studio and import a bazel project to mediapipe in attempt 1)
- [ ] Step 1: Reworking with attempt 2.
- [ ] Step 2: Recloning mediapipe.
- [ ] Step 3: Use pre setupt jdk and sdk in mediapie
- [ ] Step 4: Still the same output with attempt 1

Attempt 1.4: Use bazel 6.0.0 
- [ ] Step 1: Reworking with attempt 3.
- [ ] Step 2: Removing all bazels.
- [ ] Step 3: Install bazel using brew.
- [ ] Step 4: export GLOG_logtostderr=1 ——> THIS FIXES THE PROBLEM
- [ ] ERROR: The project you're trying to build requires Bazel 5.2.0
- [ ] Step 5: Chaging to Bazel 5.2.0
- [ ] Compiled successfully with the same one warning, YES! Printed “Hello World”!!!!!
- [ ] Rsources: Python 3.7.16 —— pip 22.3.1 —— bazel 5.2.0 —— “bash setup_android_sdk_and_ndk.sh” —— opencv@3 —— do export GLOG_logtostderr=1

RECORDING OF ATTEMPTION OF MEDIAPIPE ANDROID EXMAPLE APP

// THU MAR 2 2023

Attempt 1.0.a: HandTracking
- [ ] Step 1: Continuing attempt 1.4
- [ ] failed: missing input file 'external/androidsdk/platforms/android-30/android.jar'
- [ ] Step 2: Chaging jdk and ndk from the setup to android studio.
- [ ] SUCCESS COMPILATION!!~~

Attempt 1.0.b:
- [ ] Step 1: Continuation of attempt 1.0.a
- [ ] zsh: command not found: adb
- [ ] Step 2: exporting android_home and android_ndk_home (Same output)
- [ ] Step 3: Add ADB
- [ ] adb: no devices/emulators found
- [ ] Step 4: Connect your device

Attempt 1.0.b: EyeTracking
- [ ] Step 1: Continuation of attempt 1.0.b

Trying to run the solutions of Mediapipe to use

Fri Mar 3 2023

Attempt 1.0.b.0: Following this https://google.github.io/mediapipe/getting_started/android_solutions.html
Step 1: Import mediapipe/examples/android/solutions directory into Android Studio.
